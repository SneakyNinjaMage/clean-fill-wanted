# Clean Fill Wanted
### Portfolio Project
#### By Steven Vallarsa
--------------------
## **INTRODUCTION:**

I've had this idea in my head for almost two decades: a website to bring together those who needed soil with those who were trying to get rid of it. Instead of having dump trucks drive up and down the back roads looking for hand-painted signs asking for clean fill, what if there were a website where those who wanted and those who had could make arrangements. Of course it’s already been done, even down to the name I would have used: http://www.clean-fill-wanted.com. It doesn’t look like this website has been updated in about 20 years making it a fine candidate to get a makeover.

## **EXPECTED LIST OF FEATURES**

I’d recreate the current features using Bootstrap and more images:
- Login
- Sign Up
- Need Fill
- Have Fill
- How it works
- Volume Calculators
- Success Stories
- Contact
- About Us

## **MARKET SURVEY**

Surprisingly there aren’t many websites offering this (albeit limited appeal) service, but they all run around the same idea of connecting those with supplementary soil with those who require it.
